This is a [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) plugin for showing previews of Wikipedia, Arxiv, LessWrong, and Github links on hover, on any other site. (Wiki, LW, and Github popups are disabled on their respective sites, since these sites already have popups for internal links). Once you've added it to TamperMonkey, you can test it below:

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant)

[LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities)

[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11543)

[Github](https://github.com/Mariven/link-previews) (won't activate if you're viewing this on Github).
